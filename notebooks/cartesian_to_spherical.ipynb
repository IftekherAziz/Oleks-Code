    "## Transformation Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "To obtain the spherical coordinates of each star from its Cartesian coordinates, I used following formulae: \n",
    "$$ r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2} $$\n",
    "$$ \\theta = \\arccos{\\frac{z}{r}} $$\n",
    "$$ \\phi = \\operatorname{atan2}(y, x) $$\n",
    "where $r$ is the radial distance, $ \\theta$ is the polar angle and $\\phi$ is the azimuthal angle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Declination $\\delta$ is obtained by\n",
    "$$ \\delta = 90^{\\circ} - \\theta$$\n",
    "Right ascension $\\alpha$ is simply the azimuthal angle\n",
    "$$ \\alpha = \\phi $$\n",
    "\n",
    "To transform Cartesian velocity vectors into spherical vectors I used following matrix:\n",
    "$$ T=\n",
    "\\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "    \\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\phi) & \\sin(\\theta)\\sin(\\phi) & \\cos(\\theta) \\\\\n",
    "    \\cos(\\theta)\\cos(phi) & \\cos(\\theta)\\sin(\\phi) & -\\sin(\\theta) \\\\\n",
    "    -\\sin(\\phi) & \\cos(\\phi) & 0 \\\\\n",
    "\\end{pmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Obtained vectors $\\hat{\\theta}$, $\\hat{\\phi}$ give us the tangential velocities of the given points in spherical coordinate system. Now, to obtain the angular velocities, also defined as $\\mu_ {\\alpha} $ (right ascension) and $\\mu_\\delta$ (declination), I divided them by distance $r$. In the case of $\\mu_\\alpha$ there is also a correction factor $\\cos(\\delta) = \\sin(\\theta)$ that accounts for changes of the radius of the sphere on different latitudes.\n",
